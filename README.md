# Python Guide

[python.itaqui.to](https://python.itaqui.to) is a Spanish website that summarizes the basic and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It is built with [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) and hosted on [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Motivation

This website was initially created as a report for our OOP class at Universidad Panamericana. After publishing it on the internet, we realised that we built a great tool for people who prefer learning concepts by seeing examples rather than only explanations. Most of the concepts we added to the page include at least one example that can be experimented with by the person reading the page.

## Contributing

We are open to contributions! If you think something on the page is not well explained, or you want to add a new concept, feel free to open a pull request. Please note that all the content must be in Spanish and should include some examples if possible.
